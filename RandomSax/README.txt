You need a few things to run this script:

FIRST you must EXTRACT the folder. Put it wherever you like but, you must EXTRACT or you will get null pointer errors all over the place

Did you EXTRACT the folder?

Make sure the script and all the files are in thier own folder called */RandomSax

After you EXTRACTED THE FOLDER....the one you are reading this README from:

get

-Processing 2.x or above
-GifAnimation library (Install by going to the sketch menu and import library. Search for gifAnimation and volia)
-100.mp3 (Should be int he zip)
-saxgif.gif (Should be in the zip)

INSTRUCTIONS

Put all the files in the same folder, install the library and run the script from the same folder as the mp3 and gif files)
